## Cognitive Reappraisal
Cognitive reappraisal is a psychological strategy used to manage and alter emotional responses by changing the way one thinks about a situation. It involves reframing or reinterpreting a potentially emotion-eliciting event in a way that alters its emotional impact. Instead of trying to suppress or avoid emotions, cognitive reappraisal focuses on changing the cognitive perspective to diminish negative emotions or enhance positive ones.

For example, if someone is feeling anxious about a public speaking event, they might use cognitive reappraisal by reminding themselves that the audience is supportive and that the event is an opportunity to share valuable information, rather than focusing on the possibility of making mistakes.

This technique is often used in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help individuals cope with stress, anxiety, depression, and other emotional challenges. By changing how they think about and interpret situations, people can improve their emotional well-being and better manage their reactions to various life events.
